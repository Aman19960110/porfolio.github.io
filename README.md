**Derivative Analyst — Adroit Financials, Gurgaon, India** (May 2024 – Present)
- Executed and managed High Frequency derivative Strategy with focus on index & stock options, achieving consistent profitability in high-volatility environments.
- Developed Python-based tools for real-time options chain analysis, open interest tracking, and automating various reparative work using python.
- Designed and maintained Python pipelines to ingest and normalise high-frequency and end-of-day F&O datasets.
- Implemented a modular backtest engine for multi-leg options strategies with realistic order/sizing, margin and slippage modules.
- Created production-ready Streamlit dashboards and Plotly visualisations for trade PnL, exposures, and risk attribution used by traders and research leads.
- Collaborated across trading and engineering to translate research signals into executable strategies with clear risk limits.

## Selected Quant Projects (open-source)

### Straddle Backtest Engine — `straddle_backtest_engine`
Backtesting framework for multi-leg options strategies (straddles/strangles) with configurable order logic, slippage models, and performance reporting. Includes walk-forward and stress-test modules and example config files for reproducing net-return reports.

**Highlights:** modular config-driven backtests engine, reproducible net-return reports.

### Volatility Forecasting (GARCH) — `vol_forecasting_garch`
End-to-end volatility modelling pipeline: data ingestion, parameter estimation for GARCH-family models, one-step-ahead variance forecasting, and risk-adjusted strategy signals.

**Highlights:** automated model selection, backtested forecasts as inputs to hedging strategies, notebooked experiments and forecast visualisations.

### Bankruptcy Prediction (Poland, 2009) — `bankruptcy_2009-prediction-poland`
A supervised-learning project that forecasts corporate bankruptcy using financial statement features. Emphasis on handling imbalanced classes, multicollinearity, and explainability for risk models.

**Highlights:** feature engineering on financial ratios, SMOTE-based resampling, model explainability (SHAP), and evaluation using precision/recall for rare-event detection.

### Yield Curve Modeling — `yeild_curve_modeling`
The yeild_curve_modeling project is a quantitative finance analysis that compares two yield curve fitting approaches—Nelson–Siegel and Cubic Spline interpolation—using Indian Government Securities (G-Secs) data across maturities from 3 months to 30 years. The project includes exploratory analysis of yield correlations, detection of yield curve inversions, and a detailed comparison of model accuracy and interpretability, while also addressing the ethics of yield curve smoothing in financial modeling.

**Highlights:** curve-fitting utilities, bootstrapped confidence intervals, and code to generate yield-driven risk measures for hedging/backtesting.

### Token Live — `token_live`
The token_live project is a Streamlit-based Trading Analysis Dashboard that generates NSE derivatives tokens and analyzes trading positions through features like stock CR token generation, position matching, ATM analysis, and real-time market data visualization. It provides tools for options traders to filter securities based on parameters like open interest, ATM range, and expiry dates, while also offering comprehensive market analysis through Bhavcopy dashboards and settlement tracking with live VWAP calculations. The application is deployed as a live web app at crtoken.streamlit.app and processes trading data in CSV and Excel formats for position reconciliation and performance analysis.

**Highlights:** streaming ingestion examples, minimal order-simulation primitives, and notes on deployment patterns for low-latency prototyping.
